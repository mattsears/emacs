Emacs
======

My personal Emacs setup and customizations. Currently optimized for Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS,
Javascript, and Clojure.  Includes a customized Twilight color theme.

Features
========

anything - Quicksilver-like way to quickly access specific objects in Emacs;

espresso - Based on javascript-mode, but more robust and works better with JQuery (mostly).

gist - Emacs integration for gist.github.com
haml -
sass -
markdown
ido - Interactively do things with buffers and files.
